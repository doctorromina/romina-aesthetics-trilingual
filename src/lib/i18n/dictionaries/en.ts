    bio: [
      'I\'m Dr. Romina Raykhshtat. I started my medical career as a dentist — graduated from Kazan State Medical University and completed my residency at Kazan State Medical Academy. Then I spent 10 years in active dental practice: restorative work, prosthodontics, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, removable prosthetics. That\'s not just a line on a CV — that\'s thousands of patients and a deep understanding of how the face really works.',
      'So why did a dentist end up in aesthetics? Here\'s the thing: dentistry isn\'t just about teeth. It\'s about understanding how the face actually works — the bone structure, the muscles, the way everything moves together when you chew, swallow, talk, smile. And that\'s the key word: smile. Dentistry taught me to really see the smile. And the smile? That\'s where beauty starts. That\'s where confidence lives. That\'s why I called my practice Face&Smile Aesthetics — because you can\'t separate the two. When you understand function, you understand form.',
      'And when you\'ve spent years studying every detail of how a face is built and how it moves and ages — you bring something different to aesthetics.',
      'Today I focus entirely on injectables and device-based treatments. I see patients in Tel Aviv, Bat Yam, and Rishon LeZion, and I work in Hebrew, Russian, and English. My main areas: botulinum therapy, facial contouring, collagen stimulation, and ULTRAFORMER SMAS lifting.',

Call it longevity, call it playing the long game — every treatment I do is designed to support your skin for years, not just for now.\n\nI believe in treating the whole person. A good treatment plan isn\'t just about your skin. It\'s about how you\'re feeling, what\'s going on in your life, what you actually want. The best results come when I understand you — not just your face.\n\nI believe in subtle results. When you leave my clinic, you should look like you — just fresher, more confident, more you.',
